            <h2>Essay</h2>
            <p>Gladman was a legendary figure—well, more like a greyish, 
                oddly squishy entity—standing (or rather lying) at a whopping 25 centimeters 
                (9.8 inches) long, which, as far as mysterious beings go, is kind of underwhelming. 
                His head was completely bald, but hey, maybe he was just ahead of the curve in the alien fashion world. 
                Dark spots dotted his scalp like someone went overboard with a Sharpie.
